My most interesting experience as a serial entrepreneur was navigating through COVID and helping the media and entertainment industry by setting up a COVID 19 testing center. Your quote from you blog regarding adapting to COVID \"Take meaningful baby steps, and you will find yourself in a new dimension where the past is past, and the future looks bright again!\" resonated deeply with me as an entrepreneur who can relate to the daily grind. \nNow with Sunset Legacy Partners, I'm focused on software and data solutions for associations and non-profits. I'd love to connect and swap some war stories when you have a moment."

I’ve spent my career building and scaling businesses in media, healthcare, and tech, and now with Sunset, I'm focused on software and data solutions for associations and non-profits. One of my most prouder achievements was spending a significant time in entertainment working with clients such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Steve Aoki, The Chainsmokers, and more. \nI couldn't agree more with your case study regarding \"Micro-Learning Through Podcasts\". While in the entertainment industry, I learned the criticality of being succinct yet insightful to keep my audience engaged. However, one of the more interesting challenges has always been providing the rigth KPIs and measurables to convince customers on why/how to adapt a new strategy. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on this, especially with my media experience (I won a couple of awards in that field - shameless plug here ;)  \nWould you care to connect?"

To me this the importance of certain healthcare professionlas was very transparent during COVID when I launched a venture to help numerous entertainment industry cmopanies by setting up a COVID 19 testing center. \nWith those kind of simple yet poignant obsevation points, I am looking forward to more publications especially The Journal of Ambulatory Care Nursing with Dr. Fowler, who has some very good insights. \nI'd love to connect more and discuss how we can carry on a deeper conversation.
