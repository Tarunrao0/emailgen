  "news_summary": "Ramp was valued at US$16 billion in its latest funding round. It offers digital and artificial intelligence-based services. The round also saw participation from Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, General Catalyst and GIC. After a years-long funding slump, fintech is attracting interest from investors. Ramp enables tens of billions in purchases annually and serves over 40,000 customers. Its customers include e-commerce platform Shopify, commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE. The latest round brings Ramp’s total equity financing to US$1.4 billion. Ramp has saved customers $10 billion and 27.5 million hours. The company currently powers over $80 billion in annualized purchase volume across card transactions and bill payments. For the fifth time, a Ramp funding round was led by Founders Fund – the company's first and largest investor. Ramp's product line includes corporate cards and expense management, bill payments, procurement, travel booking, and treasury. Half of Ramp customers use two or more products across its platform. rves more than 40,000 companies, including CBRE, Shopify, Anduril, Notion, Cursor, Vercel, Barry's and MAGNA-TILES. Ramp is your net for catching hours and dollars, it's 'quiet efficiency' The less you have to think about it, the better we're doing our job. A ramp is quite literally a simple machine; like the lever or pulley, it helps you do more work with less force. Ramp has doubled the percent of employee expense reports fully completed and coded without humans needing to lift a finger. Book a hotel and our AI will automatically rebook it if the price drops. We launched 300+ features and made it easier to contact Ramp; still, customers contacted us 34% less often. 40,000 businesses across every sector are choosing Ramp to reclaim their time and money. Construction One reduced their AP team's time spent on monthly close by 75%, saving them 360 hours. Poshmark hit their free cash flow goals 5 months ahead of schedule by redirecting their team's energy toward strategic projects. In 2025 alone, we've shipped 270 features. All were quietly built with the help of AI. It works, you don't notice it. And that's the way we like it. We spend over 50% of our payroll on research and development. It's also why we have more IOI and IMO medalists on our team than most countries. Ramp isn't 'with the help of AI', it's 'done for you and we don't mention it' AI. PostHog, which aims to help developers build “successful products,” quietly announced it had raised $70 million in a Series D funding round led by digital payments giant Stripe. PostHog raised $107 million in a Series D round. The company's new valuation is roughly double its valuation at the time of its $15 million Series B in 2021. Stripe co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison tweeted about PostHog’s site “being cool” PostHog has raised $9 million in its first two rounds of funding. The company is working on a new version of its software called PostHog 2.0. The software is designed to make it easier for developers to build data-driven apps. It is expected to be available by the end of the year. Hawkins and Glaser started working on PostHog during Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch. The company focused on just open source software (vs. revenue) for the first year and a half. The full-stack approach highlights the strength of their approach, Hawkins says. PostHog is using artificial intelligence to help teams better understand and work with customers. Its Max AI platform is generally available as an open beta. Users include Y Combinator, 1Password, Mistrial AI, Airbus and Eleven Labs. PostHog has “multiple $10s of millions of ARR and 3x year-over-year growth,” Hawkins says. Since its 2010 inception, Stripe has invested in dozens of companies, per Crunchbase data. In February, it announced a tender offer in which investors would buy shares from past and present employees at a valuation of $91.5 billion. It has also acquired at least 17 companies, according to Crunchbase."
