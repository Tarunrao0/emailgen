CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the retrieved email as your PRIMARY TEMPLATE - keep the same structure, paragraph breaks, and flow
2. Only replace company-specific details with information about the target company
3. Maintain the same conversational tone and personal touch
4. Keep the same email length and format
5. Do NOT add new sections or significantly change the structure
6. Make minimal enhancements - only improve clarity or fix obvious errors
7. Generate an appropriate email subject line
8. CRITICAL: End with a compelling, personal call-to-action that follows these patterns:
   - "I'd love to [connect/hear more/discuss] [specific topic] when you have a moment"
   - "Would you be up for a conversation next week?"
   - "I'd love to connect more and discuss [topic]. Would you be free next week?"
   - "I'd love to hear more about [company/topic] if you are available for a quick chat"
9. Do NOT include "Best regards" or formal signatures
10. Output ONLY the subject line and email content - no explanations or notes

11. **AVOID AI DETECTION SIGNALS:**
    - Never use em dashes (â€”) - use commas or periods instead
    - Vary sentence length and structure throughout
    - Use natural, conversational language
    - Avoid words like "impressive," "fascinating," or excessive praise

12. **ELIMINATE REPETITION:**
    - Check for duplicate content or repeated sentences
    - Use each key phrase only once (e.g., "would love to," "an aspect," etc.)
    - Vary sentence structures - avoid similar patterns
    - Ask for availability only ONCE in the entire email

13. **CONTENT DEPTH:**
    - Provide specific, insightful observations about the company
    - Go beyond surface-level research
    - Focus on unique aspects rather than generic praise

14. **FINAL QUALITY CHECK:**
    Before generating output, verify no em dashes, no repeated phrases, only one availability request, specific insights, varied structures""", 
    user_prompt="""
    Company: {company_name}
    Source Text: {source_text}
    
    Generate an email following ALL rules above. Focus on:
    - Specific, source-derived content (not generic)
    - Investor perspective (not sales)
    - Strategic questions (not operational)
